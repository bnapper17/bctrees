            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>B.C. Trees is a Christian owned and operated tree service that started in 2019.  Our owner has been in the tree industry all of his adult life, working with his father in his childhood before branching out on his own.  After working for some of the bigger corporations Brian decided to start servicing some of his local community on top of his work duties.  After a few years of doing this and building a reputation as a trusted tree service provider and after a lot of prayer he decided to step out and make his private work his full time focus. </br></br>Brian  and a couple of trusted friends who also had years of experience in the tree industry now offer their services to anyone within 100 miles of English Indiana.  B.C. Trees specializes in storm damage and cleanup while also offering tree trimming, removal, and stump removal services.  We stand by our work and we don't take payment until the job is done and the customer is satisfied.  Brian runs his company by the mantra "Whatever it takes!", saying one way or another the job will get done.</p>
